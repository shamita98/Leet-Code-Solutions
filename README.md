# Leet-Code-Solutions
Welcome to my Leet Code repository! Here you will find my solutions for Top 150 Interview problems provided by Leet Code (<https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/>). I created this repository to keep track of my self-learning journey in Data Structures. The problems are organized into folders and tables based on the type of data structure and each solution is written in Python.
